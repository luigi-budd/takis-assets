Kartmaker, by fickleheart

HOW TO USE:
- Copy one of the KC_example/ folders and rename it (your WAD will be named after this folder)
- Edit the top of "properties.txt" to set various kart stats for your racer, and adjust the RGB colors that the
  converter considers transparent pixels if you want
- Create or paste your racer's sprites into the template provided (if you're pasting, make sure to erase the wheel
  shine from the sprites so that the converter can apply the proper shine for each frame!)
- Replace the sound files in the folder with OGG sounds that you want your racer to have (this program does not convert
  or add echo for you)
- Drag the folder onto kartmaker.exe, or run kartmaker.exe and pass the folder as an argument
- The WAD will be placed next to your character's source folder, ready to play

Ignore build.bat and the src/ folder for standard use. This is a compile script and source files. You can use it if you
want to modify the program (you need GCC installed). I make no guarantees that the program compiles on other setups.
